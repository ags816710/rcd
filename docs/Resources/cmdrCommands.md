# Setup

**Let's set up Ridgeway Concepts in under 10 minutes!**


Get started by downloading [the map and scripts](https://google.com/).

### What you'll need

- [Ridgeway Map](https://ags816710.github.io/linksoon) or any higher versions:
  - When downloading the map, make sure to make sure that you remember where you downloaded it to!

- [Roblox Studio](https://ags816710.github.io/linksoon)
  - Make sure to download and login <u>**before**</u> trying to open the map!

## Getting Started

Open the baseplate in Roblox Studio

You should be able to see the map eventually load in (if you have a slower computer, it might take a bit longer for it to work!)

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
